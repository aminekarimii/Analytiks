# Analytiks
A lightweight Analytics library that identify the user, log events and distpatch the data at one.

## Description
An android library that centralizes analytics services in one place can be a useful tool for developers who want to track the usage and performance of their app.
Should be easy as it sounds, a single implementation to start with the base analytics core features, and then you can add each analytic service separately (to preserve library size).
A debug analytics mode that can log the same properties in the debug console.
