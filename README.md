## Description

An android library that centralizes analytics services in one place can be a useful tool for
developers who want to track the usage and performance of their app.
Should be easy as it sounds, a single implementation to start with the base analytics core features,
and then you can add each analytic service separately (to preserve library size).
A debug analytics mode that can log the same properties in the debug console.

![Scheme of the library logic](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20410115/225161402-d3a7d24f-da0d-4360-abab-fe86c68f0214.png)

[![Release](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/io.github.aminekarimii/analytiks)](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/io.github.aminekarimii/analytiks)

In your app level ```build.gradle``` file, add:

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'io.github.aminekarimii:analytiks:VERSION'
    implementation 'io.github.aminekarimii:analytiks-core:VERSION'

    // You can add each Addon separately as following:
    implementation 'io.github.aminekarimii:analytiks-addon-googleanalytics:VERSION'
    implementation 'io.github.aminekarimii:analytiks-addon-mixpanel:VERSION'
    implementation 'io.github.aminekarimii:analytiks-addon-timber:VERSION'
    implementation 'io.github.aminekarimii:analytiks-addon-segment:VERSION'
}
```

## ðŸ”Œ Setup

1- In your activity, initiate the Analytiks library and keep an object to be used after as
following:

```kotlin
private lateinit var analytiks: Analytiks

override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
    // ...
    val clients = listOf(
        TimberLocalClient(),
        MixpanelAnalyticsClient(token = "YOUR_TOKEN")
        // Your addons
    )

    analytiks = Analytiks(clients)
}
```

2- Initialize the addons

```kotlin
analytiks.initialize(this.applicationContext)
```

3- You're good to go!

```kotlin
analytiks.logEvent("your_event_name")
analytiks.pushAll()
```
