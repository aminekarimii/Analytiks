# Analytiks
[![Release](https://jitpack.io/v/jitpack/android-example.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#jitpack/android-example)
![Group 54 (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20410115/228402805-3309d17a-0bc5-4404-90f8-20c9b30e33a9.png)

## Description
An android library that centralizes analytics services in one place can be a useful tool for developers who want to track the usage and performance of their app. 
Should be easy as it sounds, a single implementation to start with the base analytics core features, and then you can add each analytic service separately (to preserve library size).
A debug analytics mode that can log the same properties in the debug console.

![Scheme of the library logic](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20410115/225161402-d3a7d24f-da0d-4360-abab-fe86c68f0214.png)

## ðŸ“¥ Download
Add it in your root ```build.gradle``` at the end of repositories:
```gradle 
allprojects {
    repositories {
         ...
         maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
     }
 }
```
and in your app level ```build.gradle``` file, add:
```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.analytiks:core:{analytiks-version}'
    // You can add each addon separately as following:
    implementation 'com.analytiks.addon:analytiks-firebase:{analytiks-version}' // Optional Firebase Analytics addon
    implementation 'com.analytiks.addon:analytiks-amplitude:{analytiks-version}' // Optional Amplitude addon
    // Add any other optional addons here
}
```

## ðŸ”Œ Setup
1- In your activity, initiate the Analytiks library and keep an object to be used after as following:
```kotlin
private lateinit var analytiks: Analytiks

override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
    // ...
    val clients = listOf(
        TimberLocalClient(),
        MixpanelAnalyticsClient(token = "YOUR_TOKEN")
        // Your addons
    )

    analytiks = Analytiks(clients)
}
```
2- Initialize the addons
```kotlin
analytiks.initialize(this.applicationContext)
```

3- You're good to go!
```kotlin
analytiks.logEvent("your_event_name")
analytiks.pushAll()
```
