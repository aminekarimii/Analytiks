# Analytiks
![Group 54 (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20410115/228402805-3309d17a-0bc5-4404-90f8-20c9b30e33a9.png)

## Description
An android library that centralizes analytics services in one place can be a useful tool for developers who want to track the usage and performance of their app. 
Should be easy as it sounds, a single implementation to start with the base analytics core features, and then you can add each analytic service separately (to preserve library size).
A debug analytics mode that can log the same properties in the debug console.
